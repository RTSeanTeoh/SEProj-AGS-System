# SEProj-AGS-System
AGS System is me and my groups submission for our Software Engineering Projects.

In our Software Engineering Assignment we seek to develop a Front End for an IoT Network.
AGS is our result, after our efforts in requirements study, architecture model design, 
prototyping and Unit Testing.
